# Day 5 - Intro to Responsive Web Design

Today marked the beginning of Responsive Web Design (RWD) where we covered some basic concepts of media queries and how content should adapt to different devices and scenarios.

We cannot predict how a user will view our site, whether that will be on a mobile device or a smaller window on their giant desktop screen.  So, we have to be 'responsive' in displaying our content so that the users will have an optimal experience and be able to acheive the goals we set forth for anyone visting our application.

Today we covered:

- @media queries aka breakpoint
- device specific media queries aren't the end all be all.
- &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
- definition: viewport
