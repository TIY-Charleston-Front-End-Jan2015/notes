## Installing Node.JS

### Node Version Manager

1. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.22.1/install.sh | bash
`

2. In your `.bashrc` add the following:
```sh
export NVM_DIR="/Users/<yourusername>/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
```
This will load nvm whenever you open your shell (bash/zsh).

3. Now, in your  `.zshrc` file, add at the bottom:
```sh
# nvm
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```
4. `nvm install stable`

5. To make sure you load the default node that you've installed, use `nvm alias default stable`
