Today we covered:

## HTML - Semantic Markup

Continuing from yesterday, we talked about more HTML tags, but specifically in their role and how you use tags to help bring more meaning to the content.  

These 'newer' tags are generally called 'sectioning' tags
sectioning tags: <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>

From the MDN:
<blockquote>
Elements belonging to the sectioning content model create a section in the current outline that defines the scope of  &lt;header&gt; elements, &lt;footer&gt; elements, and heading content.
</blockquote>

Sectioning Tags:

### &lt;section&gt;

<blockquote>The HTML Section Element ( &lt;section&gt; ) represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Each &lt;section&gt; should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the &lt;section&gt; element.</blockquote> - MDN

### &lt;article&gt;

<blockquote>
The HTML <article> Element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g., in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <article> element.
</blockquote> - MDN

### &lt;aside&gt;

<blockquote>
he HTML <aside> element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that content. These sections are often represented as sidebars or inserts. They often contain the definitions on the sidebars, such as definitions from the glossary; there may also be other types of information, such as related advertisements; the biography of the author; web applications; profile information or related links on the blog.
</blockquote> - MDN

### &lt;nav&gt;

<blockquote>
The HTML Navigation Element (<nav>) represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.
</blockquote> - MDN

Flow Content tags:

### &lt;header&gt;

<blockquote>
The HTML <header> Element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, wrapped section's header, a search form, and so on.
</blockquote> -MDN

### &lt;footer&gt;

<blockquote>
The HTML &lt;footer&gt; Element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element (i.e, its nearest parent &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;details&gt;, &lt;fieldset&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;td&gt;). A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
</blockquote> - MDN
